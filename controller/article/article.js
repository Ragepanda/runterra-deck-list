                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra Beta Region Report: Shadow Isles Region and Champions</h2><h5>by Stanley Jarozewski. 2/3/2020</h5><p>The Shadow Isles region has shown to be very well rounded in the first two weeks of the Legends of Runterra open beta, as it has powerful options for aggro, control and everything in between. Here we'll look into mechanics you can expect to see in Shadow Isles, and the Champions of the Region.</p><h3>Region Identity & Keywords</h3><p>The Shadow Isles is full of cards depicting ghosts, spiders and those unfortunate enough to come across them. This region can focus on swarming the board, killing it's own units for value, or killing opponets units to control the board. It's key mechanics are Fearsome, making creatures unbloackable by anything with less than 3 power, Last Breath, and ability that triggers when the unit dies, and Ephemeral, a keyword meaning the unit will die at the end of the turn or when it strikes. This is also the only region with spells that can Drain, allowing the player to heal from the damage the spell deals.</p><h3>Champions</h3><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053T1.png'></img><p>If you enjoy spiders, Elise is the champion for you. Elise is a powerful aggresive champion whith Fearsome, that makes a spider everytime she attacks. If you can start a turn with three other spider units in play Elise will level up and give all spider allies Challenger and Fearsome, allowing you a huge advantage with attacking. Elise is also part of the starting card pool for new players, and is a great budget card to build around.  Elise's spell form, Elise's Crawling Sensation allows you to summon 2 spiders if a unit died that turn, which can go a long way to helping the Elise on board level up.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042T2.png'></img><p>Hecarim is a powerful finisher to both aggro and mid range decks, and a good build around for Ephermal cards. Hecarim summons two 3/2 Ephemeral allies everytime he attacks, and having 6 health means he isn't likely to go down in a single combat. Once leveled up Hecarim can easily overtake opponets, giving all allied ephermal units +2/+0. He also checks his level up condition from anywhere, so along as you can swing with eight Ephermal units in agame you can make this Champion into a real problem for your opponent. Hecarim's spell form, Hecrarim's Onslaught of Shadows,is great value tool for defending or attacking, giving you two 3/2 Ephermal units for the turn.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052T2.png'></img><p>Thresh is an insteresting Champion. Being a 3/6 Challenger for 5 mana is nice and help you control combat, and given how often units die in combat inLegends of Runeterra Tresh's level up condition isn't too difficult to acheive. But he does need to surive long enough to level up and attack and he will often be a priority target for enemy removal because his level up effect to put another Champion from your deck on the board is very powerful. Thresh's spell form, Thresh's The Box, is a nice control tool, dealing 3 damage to each enemy summoned that round.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030T1.png'></img><p>Kalista is a bit of tricky Champion to play, having only 2 health to start with means she is very vulenrable to removal and will often be removed before she sees three of your units die. However if unanswered and paired with the right unit her level up ability can be one of the most powerful in game, reviving a powerful ally each turn. Her spell form, Kalista's Black Spear can help mitigate you units dying by allowing you to deal 3 damage to an enemy unit for only 2 mana.</p></div>",

                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra Beta Region Report: Ionia Region and Champions</h2><h5>by Stanley Jarozewski 2/5/2020</h5><p>Ionia has early success as an aggressive region and as a supporting region for control decks in the early weeks of the Legends of Runeterra Beta. Here we'll look into mechanics you can expect to see in Ionia, and the Champions of the Region.</p><h3>Region Identity & Keywords</h3><p>Ionia is region of samurai, ninja and mythical beasts. It's most powerful mechanic is Elusive, this mechanic means the unit is only able to be blocked by other Elusive units. Ionia also has powerful Barrierpay off in Greenglade Caretaker, and enabling in Shen. Barrier only last one turn but it protects unit fromthe next instance of damage it would take. Ionia also has cards to return units to the owners hand, and Deny which counters Fast and Slow spells as well as units Skills, these tools allow Ionia to play a strong tempo game.</p><h3>Champions</h3><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009T3.png'></img><p>Zed is a great aggro tool, he is a three mana 3/2 with quick attack that creates an ephemeral 3/2 every time he attacks. Swinging in for six damage on turn three is pretty powerful, but without support Zed can can be walled with out too much trouble, and he is very vulnerable to removal at two health. His level up condition is very nice as it forces your opponents to take trades or deal with a much stronger Zed. Two four attack quick attackers can end a game fast. Zed's spell form is Zed's Shadowshift, it allows you to return an ally to hand and replace it with a 3/2 Ephemeral shadow, this can be a great trick for getting important units out of harms way.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032T2.png'></img><p>Shen's support ability will help you keep valuable units alive while you attack, and his 2/5 stat line means he is likely to survive a turn a two. If he levels up he can make combat even more difficult for the opponent giving the supported unit +3/+0 for the round, along with any other unit that receives barriers. He can be powerful is combined with Fiora or Barrier pay off units, but he doesn't have much power on his own. Shen's spell form is Shen's Stand United which is a pretty narrow combat trick, but since it is at burst speed it can occasionally lead to really profitable trades.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015T2.png'></img><p>Yasuo is a powerful champion once set up, but he takes a lot of support to really shine. A deck needs to run a high volume of Stun and Recall effects to really take advantage of Yasuo, meaning he will almost always be paired with Noxus to get the most of those effects. The fact that he can level up from anywhere is very useful, meaning you don't need to play him before he is leveled up. Yasuo's spell form is Yasuo's Steel Tempest, giving you an extra stun effect to use with the Yasou on board.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041T2.png'></img><p>Karma is a powerful late game option for controlling decks, and a decent value tool for the mid game. Karma can provide some very solid value adding random spells to your hand as spells in Legends of Runeterra have a high chance of improving your board state. Her level up requirement fits control decks very well, as all you need to do is survive until you have ten mana and then you can start doubling your spells. Karma's spell form is Karma's Insight of Ages, while the spell isn't amazing while you aren't Enlightened, it basically reads two mana draw four when you are, since you need to have another Karma out when you cast it.</p></div>",
