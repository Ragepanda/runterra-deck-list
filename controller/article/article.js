                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra Beta Region Report: Shadow Isles Region and Champions</h2><h5>by Stanley Jarozewski. 2/3/2020</h5><p>The Shadow Isles region has shown to be very well rounded in the first two weeks of the Legends of Runterra open beta, as it has powerful options for aggro, control and everything in between. Here we'll look into mechanics you can expect to see in Shadow Isles, and the Champions of the Region.</p><h3>Region Identity & Keywords</h3><p>The Shadow Isles is full of cards depicting ghosts, spiders and those unfortunate enough to come across them. This region can focus on swarming the board, killing it's own units for value, or killing opponets units to control the board. It's key mechanics are Fearsome, making creatures unbloackable by anything with less than 3 power, Last Breath, and ability that triggers when the unit dies, and Ephemeral, a keyword meaning the unit will die at the end of the turn or when it strikes. This is also the only region with spells that can Drain, allowing the player to heal from the damage the spell deals.</p><h3>Champions</h3><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053T1.png'></img><p>If you enjoy spiders, Elise is the champion for you. Elise is a powerful aggresive champion whith Fearsome, that makes a spider everytime she attacks. If you can start a turn with three other spider units in play Elise will level up and give all spider allies Challenger and Fearsome, allowing you a huge advantage with attacking. Elise is also part of the starting card pool for new players, and is a great budget card to build around.  Elise's spell form, Elise's Crawling Sensation allows you to summon 2 spiders if a unit died that turn, which can go a long way to helping the Elise on board level up.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042T2.png'></img><p>Hecarim is a powerful finisher to both aggro and mid range decks, and a good build around for Ephermal cards. Hecarim summons two 3/2 Ephemeral allies everytime he attacks, and having 6 health means he isn't likely to go down in a single combat. Once leveled up Hecarim can easily overtake opponets, giving all allied ephermal units +2/+0. He also checks his level up condition from anywhere, so along as you can swing with eight Ephermal units in agame you can make this Champion into a real problem for your opponent. Hecarim's spell form, Hecrarim's Onslaught of Shadows,is great value tool for defending or attacking, giving you two 3/2 Ephermal units for the turn.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052T2.png'></img><p>Thresh is an insteresting Champion. Being a 3/6 Challenger for 5 mana is nice and help you control combat, and given how often units die in combat inLegends of Runeterra Tresh's level up condition isn't too difficult to acheive. But he does need to surive long enough to level up and attack and he will often be a priority target for enemy removal because his level up effect to put another Champion from your deck on the board is very powerful. Thresh's spell form, Thresh's The Box, is a nice control tool, dealing 3 damage to each enemy summoned that round.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030T1.png'></img><p>Kalista is a bit of tricky Champion to play, having only 2 health to start with means she is very vulenrable to removal and will often be removed before she sees three of your units die. However if unanswered and paired with the right unit her level up ability can be one of the most powerful in game, reviving a powerful ally each turn. Her spell form, Kalista's Black Spear can help mitigate you units dying by allowing you to deal 3 damage to an enemy unit for only 2 mana.</p></div>",

                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra Beta Region Report: Ionia Region and Champions</h2><h5>by Stanley Jarozewski 2/5/2020</h5><p>Ionia has early success as an aggressive region and as a supporting region for control decks in the early weeks of the Legends of Runeterra Beta. Here we'll look into mechanics you can expect to see in Ionia, and the Champions of the Region.</p><h3>Region Identity & Keywords</h3><p>Ionia is region of samurai, ninja and mythical beasts. It's most powerful mechanic is Elusive, this mechanic means the unit is only able to be blocked by other Elusive units. Ionia also has powerful Barrierpay off in Greenglade Caretaker, and enabling in Shen. Barrier only last one turn but it protects unit fromthe next instance of damage it would take. Ionia also has cards to return units to the owners hand, and Deny which counters Fast and Slow spells as well as units Skills, these tools allow Ionia to play a strong tempo game.</p><h3>Champions</h3><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009T3.png'></img><p>Zed is a great aggro tool, he is a three mana 3/2 with quick attack that creates an ephemeral 3/2 every time he attacks. Swinging in for six damage on turn three is pretty powerful, but without support Zed can can be walled with out too much trouble, and he is very vulnerable to removal at two health. His level up condition is very nice as it forces your opponents to take trades or deal with a much stronger Zed. Two four attack quick attackers can end a game fast. Zed's spell form is Zed's Shadowshift, it allows you to return an ally to hand and replace it with a 3/2 Ephemeral shadow, this can be a great trick for getting important units out of harms way.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032T2.png'></img><p>Shen's support ability will help you keep valuable units alive while you attack, and his 2/5 stat line means he is likely to survive a turn a two. If he levels up he can make combat even more difficult for the opponent giving the supported unit +3/+0 for the round, along with any other unit that receives barriers. He can be powerful is combined with Fiora or Barrier pay off units, but he doesn't have much power on his own. Shen's spell form is Shen's Stand United which is a pretty narrow combat trick, but since it is at burst speed it can occasionally lead to really profitable trades.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015T2.png'></img><p>Yasuo is a powerful champion once set up, but he takes a lot of support to really shine. A deck needs to run a high volume of Stun and Recall effects to really take advantage of Yasuo, meaning he will almost always be paired with Noxus to get the most of those effects. The fact that he can level up from anywhere is very useful, meaning you don't need to play him before he is leveled up. Yasuo's spell form is Yasuo's Steel Tempest, giving you an extra stun effect to use with the Yasou on board.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041T2.png'></img><p>Karma is a powerful late game option for controlling decks, and a decent value tool for the mid game. Karma can provide some very solid value adding random spells to your hand as spells in Legends of Runeterra have a high chance of improving your board state. Her level up requirement fits control decks very well, as all you need to do is survive until you have ten mana and then you can start doubling your spells. Karma's spell form is Karma's Insight of Ages, while the spell isn't amazing while you aren't Enlightened, it basically reads two mana draw four when you are, since you need to have another Karma out when you cast it.</p></div>",

                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runterra Starter Bundle: Is it worth it?</h2><h5>by Stanley Jarozewski. 2/10/2020</h5><p>Many new Legends of Runterra Players ask if the Starter Bundle is worth buying. It costs 475 coins (or roughly $4.75 USD) and contains 66 cards, 11 from each region. For each region you will recieve a predetermined list of 1 epic, 4 rares, and 6 commons. This would add up to 1800 coins worth of wild cards, so you are saving 1325 coins if you wanted to craft each of these cards. But are any of these cards seeing play in the Legends of Runterra Beta?</p><h3>What Cards are in the bundle? Are they seeing play?</h3><p>So lets go over each of the cards you can receive in the Legends of Runterra Starter Bundle. I am going to give each card a 1 to 5 rating as follows.</p><ul><li>1: Near unplayable </li><li>2: Very fringe Uses</li><li>3: Used in fringe decks/Decent filler</li><li>4: Used in high teir

Legends of Runeterra Starter Bundle based on how many cards in it are playable cards, we will go with anything over a 3/5 here. So we are left with 3 epics, 10 rares, and 32 commons (you recieve 2 of each rare and common), for a total cost of 980 coins, still 505 coins over the cost of the bundle! The Legends of Runeterra Starter Bundle is a solid deal for either competitive players or those looking to fill out their collection, it would probably take a week or two of grinding to obtain most of this list, so it's really worth is in how much time you can to save yourself. Also the bundle will prorate for any cards you already have in your collection, so if you happen across some of these in your reward paths you are not losing much.</p></div></div>",

                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra 0.9.0 Patch Notes</h2><h5>By Stanley Jarozewski 02/18/2020</h5><br><img src='/img/misc/patch-090.png' class='thumbnailImg'></img><br><p>Legends of Runeterra Beta Patch 0.9.0 is here and there are some pretty major shake ups to look at. Lets look at what cards have been changed and what this means for the meta looking forward.</p><h1>Nerfs</h1><br><img src='/img/cards/01DE041.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Back to Back has gone from 5 to 6 mana. This nerf certainly wont make this card unplayable, but slowing it down by turn does help the opponent prepare against it.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO049.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Deny has gone from 3 to 4 mana. This severely hurts Deny as it can no longer be cast purely off spell mana. It also makes it harder to use as tempo or aggro tool since you need to use mana that would other wise help develope your board.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO026.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Inspiring Mentor had its health increased from 1 to 2, and its ability changed from grant a card in hand +1/+1 to +1/+0. While Inspiring Mentor himself received a buff, this is really a nerf to his playability as he can no longer be used to buff elusive units out of removal range.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO040.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Kinkou Lifeblade has had its health lowered from 3 to 2. This means he is now weak to Mystic Shot and trades with units like Shadow Assassin. Along with the nerf to Inspiring Mentor, Kinkou Lifeblade will be much harder to play.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI033.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Commander Ledros had his mana cost increased from 8 to 9, and his attack increased from 8 to 9, his ability was also also modified to cut the enemy nexus in half rounded up so he can not kill on 1 health. This cuts him out of aggro decks pretty much entirely, but doesn't change his control potential too terribly.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI035.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Rhasa, The Sunderer has been bumped from 7 to 8 mana. This shouldn't kill the card, but it does mean the opponent has more time to set up against him.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI016.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Wraithcaller no longer has fearsome. This a huge nerf for Wraithcaller, the card is still solid value but now it can be chump blocked meaning every deck basically has 4 more health than it used to against fearsome decks.</p><h1>Buffs</h1><br><img src='/img/cards/01DE042.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Lux has been given better stats and is now a 4/5 instead of a 3/4. This really ups her playablity but she is still only a fringe build around, so only time will tell if this is enough to get more Lux decks into competitive play.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO015.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Yasuo has had his quest reduced from stun or recall 6 units to stun or recall 5 units. This makes him much better in expedition where resources are more limited, but it may not be enough to make his decks more dominant in constructed.</p><img src='/img/cards/01NX007.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Arena Battlecaster has had his health increased from 1 to 2. This should help him get an extra turn of board buffing as he can no longer just be traded with 1/x cards.</p><img src='/img/cards/01NX048.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Crimson Curator has been buffed from 2 to 3 health. This a huge buff for the card as it can be a lot easier for him to end up plus cards in value.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO023.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Jeweled Protector has been given a stat buff from a 3/3 to a 4/4. It is still hard to see him as constructed playable but it makes him a much better grab in expeditions.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI005.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Scuttlegeist has been given the Fearsome keyword. This does mean he now can't be chumped by smaller creatures but it may not be enough to get him into high level play.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI051.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Tortured Prodigy has had its power raised from 3 to 4. This should not effect the cards play much, but it may help in the future if he can enable some strong combos.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>So how will these changes affect the Legends of Runeterra Beta meta. Well two aggressive decks have seen some serious nerfs. Elusives are a lot easier to take down, meaning the deck will likely look to Freljord and Omen Hawk for added buffs, but will over all be much less consitent. Fearsome will need to make some adjustments to their top end as Rhasa and Ledros are less viable, and the deck will be bit slower with Wraithcaller nerf. with Deny going up in mana Fearsome is also likely to opt out Ionia as a second region, likely picking up Piltover and Zaun or Demacia. With all of these changes it looks like the Piltover and Zaun control decks will be a lot stronger. With less pressure from Deny control can run some stronger slow spells like Trueshot Barrage, and with aggro slowed down they are likely to have an extra turn to stabilize and win. Noxus Midrange may have also opened up with the buff to Crimson Curator as he can provide some serious card advantage.</p></div>",

                layout: "<h1 style='text-align: center;'>LESSONS OF RUNETERRA 1</h1><h3 style='text-align: center;'>GETTING STARTED</h3><h4 style='text-align: center;'>Adam Edelman-Mu&ntilde;oz</h4><p>Welcome to Lessons of Runeterra. I&rsquo;m Adam, but I go by Zok online. I have a background in game design and statistics and experience playing a wide variety of competitive CCG&rsquo;s. Every other week I&rsquo;ll be looking at a topic relating to the strategy of Legends of Runeterra. As this is my first lesson we&rsquo;ll start with a few very basic topics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>WHAT IS LEGENDS OF RUNETERRA?</span></h2><p>Legends of Runeterra is a digital collectible card game (DCCG) set in Riot Games&rsquo; world of Runeterra introduced by their popular MOBA League of Legends (LoL). You won&rsquo;t need any knowledge of LoL, Runeterra, or other CCG to get started though the knowledge and strategy form other card games will help you and some familiarity with the world of Runeterra or LoL will make some of the card interactions more fun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>WHAT IS A DCCG AND WHAT MAKES LOR SPECIAL?</span></h2><p>A DCCG is a game played online where you collect playing cards and build decks to play against other players. CCG&rsquo;s were first popularized by Magic the Gathering in 1993. Other DCCG&rsquo;s include Hearthstone, MTG Arena, and a slew of other smaller competitors. Among DCCG&rsquo;s, LoR has a number of ways in which it is similar to others, and a few which make it stand out. Most notably three features set it apart from other DCCG&rsquo;s: Spell mana, Simultaneous turns, and the &ldquo;no booster packs&rdquo; philosophy. I&rsquo;ll get into the gameplay below, but for a new CCG player without other games to compare LoR to the only difference which matters is this last point. In LoR you cannot purchase randomized cards. All real money purchases are in the form of pre-set bundles or Wild Cards which can be used to make any card of your choice. Effectively you will never pay for random cards (though you can still get random rewards from weekly and long-term progression). Though randomized booster packs can be a lot of fun, especially if you have a game you can play with them (such as drafting in MTG), they can also encourage buying tons of booster packs to chase a single key card and other problematic behavior. Frankly, I have to give a ton of credit to the LoR team for this decision, it would be very easy for them to sell boosters and profit off of artificial scarcity and gambling addiction and nobody would bat an eye because boosters are fun but they made a choice here which probably hurts their bottom line in order to be more consumer friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>HOW DO I PLAY LEGENDS OF RUNETERRA?</span></h2><p>To start playing LoR use the link at the bottom of this article to go to playruneterra.com and download the game. I have felt competitive without spending a cent on this game. After you download the game, the first step to playing any CCG is to build a deck. If you&rsquo;re new, the beginner decks that LoR gives you are a good starting point and I&rsquo;ll cover the finer points of deckbuilding in a future lesson, but for now all you need to know is your deck needs 40 cards, you can&rsquo;t have more than 3 of any card in your deck, your deck can only have cards from two regions, and you should probably have a mix of units and spells and a mix of mana costs. After you have a deck, start up a game. There are some tutorials newer players can play through to learn the basics (and if you&rsquo;ve played through them you can skip this section). The first rule is that cards cost mana. You get 1 mana at the start of the first turn and each turn you get the amount you got the previous turn plus 1 to a maximum of 10 (fans of Hearthstone will recognize this system). Additionally, up to 3 mana you didn&rsquo;t spend will be saved as &ldquo;spell mana&rdquo; which can only be used on spells (and can be saved as spell mana in the future) but the rest will vanish. This is a fairly major difference from any other CCG and one that works very well. It creates incentives to carefully think about how you utilize your mana each turn and whether you can make better use of it down the line.</p><p>Each player draws one card each turn. Then you and your opponent will alternate playing one card (with a few exceptions) until neither player plays a card, then the next turn will start. This is a second major departure from other CCG&rsquo;s where the default is that only one player plays at a time and only a select few cards can be played or have effects during the opponent&rsquo;s turn. This is also one of the biggest draws to LoR as a game, because you can play any card on any turn you are very rarely helpless against what your opponent is doing. The one way in which turns are asymmetric is that only one player can attack on each turn. The attacking player will have a glowing sword on the right side of the board. Attacking can be done when it is your round to play a card. You can attack with as many units as you have on board (the board limit is 6 units). Then your opponent has the chance to block. A blocked unit will battle the unit blocking it (each will take damage equal to the other&rsquo;s attack and damage taken by units will not heal), an unblocked unit will deal damage to the enemy nexus equal to its attack. The game ends when a player has had their nexus health reduced from 20 to 0.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>CONCLUSIONS</span></h2><p>The above is all you really need to know to get started with Legends of Runeterra, an introduction for those of you just starting out. I&rsquo;ll be back two weeks from now with a deeper look at the strategy of LoR as I dive into deck archetypes, deckbuilding, and some gaming history.</p><p><a href='https://playruneterra.com/en-us/?app=bacon&amp;source=google&amp;campaign_name=L10&amp;campaign_id=6938181282&amp;keyword=legends%20of%20runeterra&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8OL7sPPN5wIViJOzCh38hQV5EAAYASAAEgJRcvD_BwE'>https://playruneterra.com/en-us/?app=bacon&amp;source=google&amp;campaign_name=L10&amp;campaign_id=6938181282&amp;keyword=legends%20of%20runeterra&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8OL7sPPN5wIViJOzCh38hQV5EAAYASAAEgJRcvD_BwE</a></p>",

Well take a gander at this:</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'><img src='/img/misc/grandmaster_rank.png' class='img-center' alt='Legends of Runeterra Laddering Guide - Ranked Play Grandmaster'/></p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>You can also listen to the podcast I do with two other Runeterra players, right here on the homepage of the website and on <a href='https://soundcloud.com/runtheterra'>Soundcloud</a></p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>So now that you have my bona fides, let's get down to business.</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>This article is mainly intended for Legends of Runeterra ladder grinders that are hard stuck somewhere in the range of high Gold to low Platinum rank.</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>I'll take for granted that you already know the basics of how to play Runeterra and in general play relatively well in game. The main focus for this article will be decision made outside of a game of Legends of Runeterra, what we call meta decisions.</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>Now, as a Grandmaster player, nearly every decision I make is meta: What deck I play, when I ladder, how I emote. Now the emote decisions might be too advanced for you, but here are 3 tips I want to give you for your Legends of Runeterra Laddering experience:</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>1) Maintain a spreadsheet as you play</p></span></h2><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'><img src='/img/misc/ladder_spreadsheet.png' class='img-center' alt='Legends of Runeterra Laddering Guide - Ranked Play Ladder Spreadsheet'/></p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>Here you can see an example of my spreadsheet, I keep what deck I play, the opponent's name, their deck, whether the game was a Win or Loss (as you can see I only win, btw) as well as a cell for notes about the match. Maybe what cards I felt were great in the matchup, whether I correctly predicted what cards they were holding, etc.&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>A spreadsheet also allows you to uncover weaknesses that aren't immediately obvious. Maybe you see there's one matchup in particular you are terrible against you could shore up by playing a different deck, or playing differently. It also allows you to keep track of the types of decks you are facing. Say you notice the past 10 games you've queued exclusively against greedy Karma control decks. Which means it could be the case a lot of players are currently on heavy control decks.

                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra Beta Region Report: Shadow Isles Region and Champions</h2><h5>by Stanley Jarozewski. 2/3/2020</h5><p>The Shadow Isles region has shown to be very well rounded in the first two weeks of the Legends of Runterra open beta, as it has powerful options for aggro, control and everything in between. Here we'll look into mechanics you can expect to see in Shadow Isles, and the Champions of the Region.</p><h3>Region Identity & Keywords</h3><p>The Shadow Isles is full of cards depicting ghosts, spiders and those unfortunate enough to come across them. This region can focus on swarming the board, killing it's own units for value, or killing opponets units to control the board. It's key mechanics are Fearsome, making creatures unbloackable by anything with less than 3 power, Last Breath, and ability that triggers when the unit dies, and Ephemeral, a keyword meaning the unit will die at the end of the turn or when it strikes. This is also the only region with spells that can Drain, allowing the player to heal from the damage the spell deals.</p><h3>Champions</h3><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI053T1.png'></img><p>If you enjoy spiders, Elise is the champion for you. Elise is a powerful aggresive champion whith Fearsome, that makes a spider everytime she attacks. If you can start a turn with three other spider units in play Elise will level up and give all spider allies Challenger and Fearsome, allowing you a huge advantage with attacking. Elise is also part of the starting card pool for new players, and is a great budget card to build around.  Elise's spell form, Elise's Crawling Sensation allows you to summon 2 spiders if a unit died that turn, which can go a long way to helping the Elise on board level up.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI042T2.png'></img><p>Hecarim is a powerful finisher to both aggro and mid range decks, and a good build around for Ephermal cards. Hecarim summons two 3/2 Ephemeral allies everytime he attacks, and having 6 health means he isn't likely to go down in a single combat. Once leveled up Hecarim can easily overtake opponets, giving all allied ephermal units +2/+0. He also checks his level up condition from anywhere, so along as you can swing with eight Ephermal units in agame you can make this Champion into a real problem for your opponent. Hecarim's spell form, Hecrarim's Onslaught of Shadows,is great value tool for defending or attacking, giving you two 3/2 Ephermal units for the turn.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI052T2.png'></img><p>Thresh is an insteresting Champion. Being a 3/6 Challenger for 5 mana is nice and help you control combat, and given how often units die in combat inLegends of Runeterra Tresh's level up condition isn't too difficult to acheive. But he does need to surive long enough to level up and attack and he will often be a priority target for enemy removal because his level up effect to put another Champion from your deck on the board is very powerful. Thresh's spell form, Thresh's The Box, is a nice control tool, dealing 3 damage to each enemy summoned that round.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01SI030T1.png'></img><p>Kalista is a bit of tricky Champion to play, having only 2 health to start with means she is very vulenrable to removal and will often be removed before she sees three of your units die. However if unanswered and paired with the right unit her level up ability can be one of the most powerful in game, reviving a powerful ally each turn. Her spell form, Kalista's Black Spear can help mitigate you units dying by allowing you to deal 3 damage to an enemy unit for only 2 mana.</p></div>",

                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra Beta Region Report: Ionia Region and Champions</h2><h5>by Stanley Jarozewski 2/5/2020</h5><p>Ionia has early success as an aggressive region and as a supporting region for control decks in the early weeks of the Legends of Runeterra Beta. Here we'll look into mechanics you can expect to see in Ionia, and the Champions of the Region.</p><h3>Region Identity & Keywords</h3><p>Ionia is region of samurai, ninja and mythical beasts. It's most powerful mechanic is Elusive, this mechanic means the unit is only able to be blocked by other Elusive units. Ionia also has powerful Barrierpay off in Greenglade Caretaker, and enabling in Shen. Barrier only last one turn but it protects unit fromthe next instance of damage it would take. Ionia also has cards to return units to the owners hand, and Deny which counters Fast and Slow spells as well as units Skills, these tools allow Ionia to play a strong tempo game.</p><h3>Champions</h3><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009T2.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO009T3.png'></img><p>Zed is a great aggro tool, he is a three mana 3/2 with quick attack that creates an ephemeral 3/2 every time he attacks. Swinging in for six damage on turn three is pretty powerful, but without support Zed can can be walled with out too much trouble, and he is very vulnerable to removal at two health. His level up condition is very nice as it forces your opponents to take trades or deal with a much stronger Zed. Two four attack quick attackers can end a game fast. Zed's spell form is Zed's Shadowshift, it allows you to return an ally to hand and replace it with a 3/2 Ephemeral shadow, this can be a great trick for getting important units out of harms way.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO032T2.png'></img><p>Shen's support ability will help you keep valuable units alive while you attack, and his 2/5 stat line means he is likely to survive a turn a two. If he levels up he can make combat even more difficult for the opponent giving the supported unit +3/+0 for the round, along with any other unit that receives barriers. He can be powerful is combined with Fiora or Barrier pay off units, but he doesn't have much power on his own. Shen's spell form is Shen's Stand United which is a pretty narrow combat trick, but since it is at burst speed it can occasionally lead to really profitable trades.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO015T2.png'></img><p>Yasuo is a powerful champion once set up, but he takes a lot of support to really shine. A deck needs to run a high volume of Stun and Recall effects to really take advantage of Yasuo, meaning he will almost always be paired with Noxus to get the most of those effects. The fact that he can level up from anywhere is very useful, meaning you don't need to play him before he is leveled up. Yasuo's spell form is Yasuo's Steel Tempest, giving you an extra stun effect to use with the Yasou on board.</p><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041T1.png'></img><img class='articleCard' src='/img/cards/01IO041T2.png'></img><p>Karma is a powerful late game option for controlling decks, and a decent value tool for the mid game. Karma can provide some very solid value adding random spells to your hand as spells in Legends of Runeterra have a high chance of improving your board state. Her level up requirement fits control decks very well, as all you need to do is survive until you have ten mana and then you can start doubling your spells. Karma's spell form is Karma's Insight of Ages, while the spell isn't amazing while you aren't Enlightened, it basically reads two mana draw four when you are, since you need to have another Karma out when you cast it.</p></div>",

It costs 475 coins (or roughly $4.75 USD) and contains 66 cards, 11 from each region. For each region you will recieve a predetermined list of 1 epic, 4 rares, and 6 commons. This would add up to 1800 coins worth of wild cards, so you are saving 1325 coins if you wanted to craft each of these cards.

Legends of Runeterra Starter Bundle based on how many cards in it are playable cards, we will go with anything over a 3/5 here. So we are left with 3 epics, 10 rares, and 32 commons (you recieve 2 of each rare and common), for a total cost of 980 coins, still 505 coins over the cost of the bundle! The Legends of Runeterra Starter Bundle is a solid deal for either competitive players or those looking to fill out their collection, it would probably take a week or two of grinding to obtain most of this list, so it's really worth is in how much time you can to save yourself. Also the bundle will prorate for any cards you already have in your collection, so if you happen across some of these in your reward paths you are not losing much.</p></div></div>",

                layout: "<div><h2>Legends of Runeterra 0.9.0 Patch Notes</h2><h5>By Stanley Jarozewski 02/18/2020</h5><br><img src='/img/misc/patch-090.png' class='thumbnailImg'></img><br><p>Legends of Runeterra Beta Patch 0.9.0 is here and there are some pretty major shake ups to look at. Lets look at what cards have been changed and what this means for the meta looking forward.</p><h1>Nerfs</h1><br><img src='/img/cards/01DE041.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Back to Back has gone from 5 to 6 mana. This nerf certainly wont make this card unplayable, but slowing it down by turn does help the opponent prepare against it.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO049.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Deny has gone from 3 to 4 mana. This severely hurts Deny as it can no longer be cast purely off spell mana. It also makes it harder to use as tempo or aggro tool since you need to use mana that would other wise help develope your board.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO026.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Inspiring Mentor had its health increased from 1 to 2, and its ability changed from grant a card in hand +1/+1 to +1/+0. While Inspiring Mentor himself received a buff, this is really a nerf to his playability as he can no longer be used to buff elusive units out of removal range.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO040.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Kinkou Lifeblade has had its health lowered from 3 to 2. This means he is now weak to Mystic Shot and trades with units like Shadow Assassin. Along with the nerf to Inspiring Mentor, Kinkou Lifeblade will be much harder to play.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI033.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Commander Ledros had his mana cost increased from 8 to 9, and his attack increased from 8 to 9, his ability was also also modified to cut the enemy nexus in half rounded up so he can not kill on 1 health. This cuts him out of aggro decks pretty much entirely, but doesn't change his control potential too terribly.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI035.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Rhasa, The Sunderer has been bumped from 7 to 8 mana. This shouldn't kill the card, but it does mean the opponent has more time to set up against him.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI016.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Wraithcaller no longer has fearsome. This a huge nerf for Wraithcaller, the card is still solid value but now it can be chump blocked meaning every deck basically has 4 more health than it used to against fearsome decks.</p><h1>Buffs</h1><br><img src='/img/cards/01DE042.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Lux has been given better stats and is now a 4/5 instead of a 3/4. This really ups her playablity but she is still only a fringe build around, so only time will tell if this is enough to get more Lux decks into competitive play.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO015.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Yasuo has had his quest reduced from stun or recall 6 units to stun or recall 5 units. This makes him much better in expedition where resources are more limited, but it may not be enough to make his decks more dominant in constructed.</p><img src='/img/cards/01NX007.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Arena Battlecaster has had his health increased from 1 to 2. This should help him get an extra turn of board buffing as he can no longer just be traded with 1/x cards.</p><img src='/img/cards/01NX048.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Crimson Curator has been buffed from 2 to 3 health. This a huge buff for the card as it can be a lot easier for him to end up plus cards in value.</p><img src='/img/cards/01IO023.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Jeweled Protector has been given a stat buff from a 3/3 to a 4/4. It is still hard to see him as constructed playable but it makes him a much better grab in expeditions.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI005.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Scuttlegeist has been given the Fearsome keyword. This does mean he now can't be chumped by smaller creatures but it may not be enough to get him into high level play.</p><img src='/img/cards/01SI051.png' class='articleCard'></img><p>Tortured Prodigy has had its power raised from 3 to 4. This should not effect the cards play much, but it may help in the future if he can enable some strong combos.</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>So how will these changes affect the Legends of Runeterra Beta meta. Well two aggressive decks have seen some serious nerfs. Elusives are a lot easier to take down, meaning the deck will likely look to Freljord and Omen Hawk for added buffs, but will over all be much less consitent. Fearsome will need to make some adjustments to their top end as Rhasa and Ledros are less viable, and the deck will be bit slower with Wraithcaller nerf. with Deny going up in mana Fearsome is also likely to opt out Ionia as a second region, likely picking up Piltover and Zaun or Demacia. With all of these changes it looks like the Piltover and Zaun control decks will be a lot stronger. With less pressure from Deny control can run some stronger slow spells like Trueshot Barrage, and with aggro slowed down they are likely to have an extra turn to stabilize and win. Noxus Midrange may have also opened up with the buff to Crimson Curator as he can provide some serious card advantage.</p></div>",

                layout: "<h1 style='text-align: center;'>LESSONS OF RUNETERRA 1</h1><h3 style='text-align: center;'>GETTING STARTED</h3><h4 style='text-align: center;'>Adam Edelman-Mu&ntilde;oz</h4><p>Welcome to Lessons of Runeterra. I&rsquo;m Adam, but I go by Zok online. I have a background in game design and statistics and experience playing a wide variety of competitive CCG&rsquo;s. Every other week I&rsquo;ll be looking at a topic relating to the strategy of Legends of Runeterra. As this is my first lesson we&rsquo;ll start with a few very basic topics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>WHAT IS LEGENDS OF RUNETERRA?</span></h2><p>Legends of Runeterra is a digital collectible card game (DCCG) set in Riot Games&rsquo; world of Runeterra introduced by their popular MOBA League of Legends (LoL). You won&rsquo;t need any knowledge of LoL, Runeterra, or other CCG to get started though the knowledge and strategy form other card games will help you and some familiarity with the world of Runeterra or LoL will make some of the card interactions more fun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>WHAT IS A DCCG AND WHAT MAKES LOR SPECIAL?</span></h2><p>A DCCG is a game played online where you collect playing cards and build decks to play against other players. CCG&rsquo;s were first popularized by Magic the Gathering in 1993. Other DCCG&rsquo;s include Hearthstone, MTG Arena, and a slew of other smaller competitors. Among DCCG&rsquo;s, LoR has a number of ways in which it is similar to others, and a few which make it stand out. Most notably three features set it apart from other DCCG&rsquo;s: Spell mana, Simultaneous turns, and the &ldquo;no booster packs&rdquo; philosophy. I&rsquo;ll get into the gameplay below, but for a new CCG player without other games to compare LoR to the only difference which matters is this last point. In LoR you cannot purchase randomized cards. All real money purchases are in the form of pre-set bundles or Wild Cards which can be used to make any card of your choice. Effectively you will never pay for random cards (though you can still get random rewards from weekly and long-term progression). Though randomized booster packs can be a lot of fun, especially if you have a game you can play with them (such as drafting in MTG), they can also encourage buying tons of booster packs to chase a single key card and other problematic behavior. Frankly, I have to give a ton of credit to the LoR team for this decision, it would be very easy for them to sell boosters and profit off of artificial scarcity and gambling addiction and nobody would bat an eye because boosters are fun but they made a choice here which probably hurts their bottom line in order to be more consumer friendly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>HOW DO I PLAY LEGENDS OF RUNETERRA?</span></h2><p>To start playing LoR use the link at the bottom of this article to go to playruneterra.com and download the game. I have felt competitive without spending a cent on this game. After you download the game, the first step to playing any CCG is to build a deck. If you&rsquo;re new, the beginner decks that LoR gives you are a good starting point and I&rsquo;ll cover the finer points of deckbuilding in a future lesson, but for now all you need to know is your deck needs 40 cards, you can&rsquo;t have more than 3 of any card in your deck, your deck can only have cards from two regions, and you should probably have a mix of units and spells and a mix of mana costs. After you have a deck, start up a game. There are some tutorials newer players can play through to learn the basics (and if you&rsquo;ve played through them you can skip this section). The first rule is that cards cost mana. You get 1 mana at the start of the first turn and each turn you get the amount you got the previous turn plus 1 to a maximum of 10 (fans of Hearthstone will recognize this system). Additionally, up to 3 mana you didn&rsquo;t spend will be saved as &ldquo;spell mana&rdquo; which can only be used on spells (and can be saved as spell mana in the future) but the rest will vanish. This is a fairly major difference from any other CCG and one that works very well. It creates incentives to carefully think about how you utilize your mana each turn and whether you can make better use of it down the line.</p><p>Each player draws one card each turn. Then you and your opponent will alternate playing one card (with a few exceptions) until neither player plays a card, then the next turn will start. This is a second major departure from other CCG&rsquo;s where the default is that only one player plays at a time and only a select few cards can be played or have effects during the opponent&rsquo;s turn. This is also one of the biggest draws to LoR as a game, because you can play any card on any turn you are very rarely helpless against what your opponent is doing. The one way in which turns are asymmetric is that only one player can attack on each turn. The attacking player will have a glowing sword on the right side of the board. Attacking can be done when it is your round to play a card. You can attack with as many units as you have on board (the board limit is 6 units). Then your opponent has the chance to block. A blocked unit will battle the unit blocking it (each will take damage equal to the other&rsquo;s attack and damage taken by units will not heal), an unblocked unit will deal damage to the enemy nexus equal to its attack. The game ends when a player has had their nexus health reduced from 20 to 0.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>CONCLUSIONS</span></h2><p>The above is all you really need to know to get started with Legends of Runeterra, an introduction for those of you just starting out. I&rsquo;ll be back two weeks from now with a deeper look at the strategy of LoR as I dive into deck archetypes, deckbuilding, and some gaming history.</p><p><a href='https://playruneterra.com/en-us/?app=bacon&amp;source=google&amp;campaign_name=L10&amp;campaign_id=6938181282&amp;keyword=legends%20of%20runeterra&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8OL7sPPN5wIViJOzCh38hQV5EAAYASAAEgJRcvD_BwE'>https://playruneterra.com/en-us/?app=bacon&amp;source=google&amp;campaign_name=L10&amp;campaign_id=6938181282&amp;keyword=legends%20of%20runeterra&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI8OL7sPPN5wIViJOzCh38hQV5EAAYASAAEgJRcvD_BwE</a></p>",

Well take a gander at this:</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'><img src='/img/misc/grandmaster_rank.png' class='img-center' alt='Legends of Runeterra Laddering Guide - Ranked Play Grandmaster'/></p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>You can also listen to the podcast I do with two other Runeterra players, right here on the homepage of the website and on <a href='https://soundcloud.com/runtheterra'>Soundcloud</a></p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>So now that you have my bona fides, let's get down to business.</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>This article is mainly intended for Legends of Runeterra ladder grinders that are hard stuck somewhere in the range of high Gold to low Platinum rank.</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>I'll take for granted that you already know the basics of how to play Runeterra and in general play relatively well in game. The main focus for this article will be decision made outside of a game of Legends of Runeterra, what we call meta decisions.</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>Now, as a Grandmaster player, nearly every decision I make is meta: What deck I play, when I ladder, how I emote. Now the emote decisions might be too advanced for you, but here are 3 tips I want to give you for your Legends of Runeterra Laddering experience:</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'><h2><span style='color: #d68fd6;'>1) Maintain a spreadsheet as you play</p></span></h2><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'><img src='/img/misc/ladder_spreadsheet.png' class='img-center' alt='Legends of Runeterra Laddering Guide - Ranked Play Ladder Spreadsheet'/></p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>Here you can see an example of my spreadsheet, I keep what deck I play, the opponent's name, their deck, whether the game was a Win or Loss (as you can see I only win, btw) as well as a cell for notes about the match. Maybe what cards I felt were great in the matchup, whether I correctly predicted what cards they were holding, etc.&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>&nbsp;</p><p style='text-align: left;'>A spreadsheet also allows you to uncover weaknesses that aren't immediately obvious. Maybe you see there's one matchup in particular you are terrible against you could shore up by playing a different deck, or playing differently. It also allows you to keep track of the types of decks you are facing. Say you notice the past 10 games you've queued exclusively against greedy Karma control decks.
